                <p>Our flow works in a simple manner: You start by uploading a document using our form. We then create a special bot that learns from your document. This bot can answer questions and do other helpful things for you based on what it learned from the document.</p>

                <p>Once you've uploaded a file, we'll work behind the scenes to train the bot. This means we'll go through the content and use external GPT tools to create models that fit what you need. </p>

                <h2 id="using">4. Using the Chatbot</h2>
